## Example Markdown Input

```markdown
The study of historical methodology has undergone significant transformations in recent decades.[^1] Scholars have increasingly recognized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the past. This shift represents a fundamental change in how historians approach their craft.

The role of primary sources cannot be overstated in historical research. As one prominent historian noted:

> The careful analysis of primary documents forms the foundation of all legitimate historical inquiry. Without access to original sources, historians are merely speculating about the past. The interpretation of these sources requires both skill and careful attention to context, including the circumstances under which documents were created and preserved.

This perspective has shaped modern archival practices and influenced how institutions preserve historical materials.[^2]

## The Impact of Digital Technology

The digital revolution has transformed historical research in numerous ways.[^3] Digitization projects have made previously inaccessible documents available to researchers worldwide. This democratization of access has both benefits and challenges.

Some scholars have expressed concern about the overreliance on digitized materials:

> While digital archives provide unprecedented access to historical documents, researchers must remain aware of the limitations of these collections. Not all materials have been digitized, and the selection process itself reflects contemporary biases about what is considered historically significant. Furthermore, the experience of handling physical documents provides contextual information that cannot be replicated in digital form.

These concerns highlight the ongoing debate about methodology in the digital age.[^3]

## Conclusion

The evolution of historical methodology reflects broader changes in academic practice and technology. As new tools and approaches emerge, historians must balance innovation with established principles of rigorous scholarship.

## Additional Examples

### Multiple Consecutive Citations (Ibid. Test)

```markdown
This claim is supported by evidence.[^1] This related claim comes from the same source.[^1] However, this statement has a different source.[^2]

[^1]: Jane Doe, *Important Research* (Boston: Publisher, 2023), 50.
[^2]: John Smith, *Another Study* (New York: Publisher, 2022), 25.
```

The second `[^1]` reference should automatically become "Ibid." in the footnotes.

### Mixed Formatting

```markdown
Academic writing often requires **emphasis** on key terms and *titles* of works. Lists can be useful for organizing information:

1. First point of analysis
2. Second point with supporting evidence
3. Third point leading to conclusion

The integration of various formatting elements creates a polished final document.
